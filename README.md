# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## "MovieHub: React app for browsing and watching movie trailers"

> My app is a React-based movies app that allows users to easily browse and search for movies they want to watch. I designed the app with a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and find the movies they are interested in.

To start using my app, users can simply browse through the available movies or use the search bar to find a specific movie. I implemented a JSON-based database to store all of the movies in my app, making it easy for users to access a wide variety of movies from various genres.

For users who are administrators, I implemented several features that allow them to manage the movie database and user information. They can add, update, or delete movies, as well as manage user accounts. This makes it easy for administrators to keep the movie database up-to-date and ensure that users have access to the latest and greatest movies.

For users who are regular users, they can easily sign up for an account and save their information to the JSON database. Once logged in, they can access their account information and easily browse and watch movie trailers. This feature ensures that users can quickly access their favorite movies and keep track of their viewing history.

I used browser routing to enable users to easily navigate between pages in my app. This means that users can quickly move from the home page to the movie details page, and then back to the home page without any lag or delay. This feature makes my app easy and fun to use.

To display and fetch data from the JSON database, I used fetch and axios, which made it easy to implement and manage the data. Additionally, I ensured that the movie details page included a movie trailer so that users could easily preview the movie before watching it.

Overall, I am very proud of my app, which provides users with an easy and enjoyable way to browse and watch their favorite movies.
